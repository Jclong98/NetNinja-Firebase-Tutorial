## About

I followed along with [NetNinja's Firebase 9 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zdvmgGsww0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jERUGvbudErNCeSZHWUVlb) while trying to use other technologies. This is also my first writing a composable, so I've been able to learn a lot from this project.

Some of the other technologies include but are not limited to:

- Typescript
- Vite
- Vue 3
- WindiCSS
